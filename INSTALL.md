Installation - Notes Project
============================

The Notes project is driven by the following tools, technologies, and services:

* Git
* Node.js

## Development

To get the basic tools on your development machine:

### Git

Git comes installed by default on many OS's. If you don't find it available
on the command line with:

```
$ git --version
```

then download a package at the
[Official Downloads Page](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

Some additional resources:

* [Git Documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc)
* [Git Cheatsheet](https://na1.salesforce.com/help/pdfs/en/salesforce_git_developer_cheatsheet.pdf)

On Windows, you may need to add:

```
;C:\Program Files\Git\bin;C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
```

to "Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > System Variables > Path"
to get `git` properly available from the command line.

### Node.js

Node.js is used to drive the entire frontend build. If you don't find a modern
version installed on your OS, download a package at the
[Official Downloads Page](http://nodejs.org/download/)

Verify installation with:

```
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```
