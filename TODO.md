Tasks
=====

## Browserify

* Gruntfile.js:
    * Add tests, reenable tasks, etc.
    * New `watch`, etc. tasks

* README: Add dev. workflow, etc.

* LS vs. REST: Check build switch and test more.
    * Maybe move **entirely** to `config.js` for everything...

* Backbone can't get jQuery. Need an expose or a dependency or something.
    * `browserify-shim`? Package.json deps?

* Bootstrap is not available. (Maybe still need `bower` for this?).
    * `npm install bootstrap` is **wrong** ;)

* Minification: `uglifyify` or `minifyify`

* Optional Libs: `grunt-watchify`, `browserify-shim`.

## Skeleton

* Remove `notes` app HTML setup and make clean.

## Full

* Prune all extra bower and npm dependencies (probably lots!)

## Meta Infrastructure

* Build index.html for entire site.
* Maybe add offcanvas nav for site, projects.
